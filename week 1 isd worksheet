ISD Week 1 Exercise
1. What is a code repository (often also called version control system) used for? 
A code repository is a place to manage collections of information like all source code, related documents, repositories. All changes to these files are identified by a number or letter code this is known as revision. These revisions can be compared, restored and some of the file types can be merged
2. Why is it advantageous to use a code repository? 
Source code management, version control, code repository and revision control are all variations of a centrally managed hub for storing all your code and documentation.
3. Describe the different “layers” of Software that exist on a typical computer and explain why there are different layers of software. 

4. Describe what an algorithm is and explain why it is a useful “tool” to translate from a human level problem (we can think of) to a computer program. 

5. Write an algorithm that describes how to make scrambled eggs, try to use control words, like IF, WHEN, UNTIL, WHILE, WAIT, AND, OR. 
1. Beat the eggs FOR 30 seconds in a bowl UNTIL evenly coloured 
2. Heat up a frying pan over medium heat UNTIL hot
3. Melt some butter OR pour in sunflower oil in the frying pan
4. Cook the eggs on the pan AND stir eggs WHILE cooking
5. Serve the scrambled eggs
6. Is Idle (the Python language shell) an Interpreter or an Compiler or both? Explain your answer.

Practical work using Python
1) Write a command in the Idle shell that says “Hello world” 
print(“Hello world”)
 

2) Write a program that produces the following output: Hello World I am in my ISD class right now
print(“Hello world I am in my ISD class right now”)
 
3) Write a program that asks the user for his/her name and produces an output like: Hi there, what is your name? >User input to be read< Hello (Users name) How are you?
 

4) Write a program that asks for two numbers (Python has all the basic mathematical functions in place, like +,- etc.), adds them up and displays the result.
