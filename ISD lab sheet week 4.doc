ISD lab sheet week 4
1.	Assume the following list:   a = [66.25, 333, 333, 1, 1234.5]

If you perform the following operations on the list:

a.insert(2, -1)
a.append(333)

What will the list look like?


Now you perform: 
a.index(333)
What will the output of this operation be?



a.remove(333)
What will the list look like?


a.reverse()
 What will the list look like?


>>> a.sort()
What will the list look like?

2.
	Write a short program to create a list of squares for numbers up to 10. 
Start with an empty list called squares and append squares of numbers from 0 up to 10.
Print the contents of your list.
 


3.
nums = []
for x in [1,2,3]:
         for y in [3,1,4]:
                if x != y:
                        nums.append((x, y))
 nums

What is the output from above? 
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]




4.
Create a program that will keep track of items for a shopping list. 
The program should start with an empty list and keep asking for new items until nothing is entered (no input followed by enter/return key). 
The program should then display the full shopping list.

items=list()
while True:
    item=input("Enter item : ")
    if len(item)==0:
        break
    items.append(item)
print("List of items is : ")
print(items)
 

5.	Write a program that will ask the user to enter two short sentences and then: 

-	Concatenate the two sentences into one long sentence 
-	Split the sentence into a list of words
-	Sort the words in alphabetical order and print them out
-	Print the total number of words contained in your list

-	Create a dictionary that will store each word together with the count of the occurrence of each word in your sentence. 
  
-	Print each item from the dictionary
