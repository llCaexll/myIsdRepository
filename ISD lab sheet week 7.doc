	ISD lab sheet week 7
For the practical part of this lab please save the Python programs that you create and take screenshots of the execution (evaluation) of your programs.

1a. Write a class “Student” with a state that stores information about the students surname, last name, student number and course. The behaviour of the “Student” class should enable a student object to get and set each of the Student class variables and to print out all of the Student’s information.

1b. Write a program with a main function that imports the Student class, creates a student object and prints and changes some of the information (like first name, last name) of the student object. 


2.
A simulated cash register that tracks the item count and the total amount looks like this:  due

class CashRegister :
   
   def __init__(self) :
      self._itemCount = 0
      self._totalPrice = 0.0
      
   
   def addItem(self, price) :
      self._itemCount = self._itemCount + 1
      self._totalPrice = self._totalPrice + price 
      
   
   def getTotal(self) :
      return self._totalPrice

   def getCount(self) :
      return self._itemCount

   def clear(self) :
      self._itemCount = 0
      self._totalPrice = 0.0

   def giveChange(self, payment) :
      return payment-self._totalPrice
      



2a.	

Write a TestRegister program to test the addItem, getTotal, getCount and giveChange methods of the CashRegister class
