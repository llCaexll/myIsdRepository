ISD lab sheet week 2

Github: 
1) If you haven’t done so yet, please sign up for Github https://github.com/
2) Create a repository for your source code
3) Commit (upload) the code from week 1 to your repository

For the practical part of this lab please save the Python programs that you create and take screenshots of the execution (evaluation) of your programs. Commit (upload) all source code you create to your code repository. 
1.	What will the output be from the following code?
num = 4		4(num)
num*=2		8(num)
num1=num+2		10(num1)
num1+=3		13(num1)
print(num1)		13(output)

2.	What do the following lines of code output? Why do they give a different answer?
print(2 / 3)		0.6666666666666666(output) 	quotient: / 
print(2 // 3)		0(output) 				integer quotient: //
quotient(/) gives you an exact answer including decimal points while integer quotient(//) rounds up the answer to the nearest number


3.	All of the variable names below can be used. But which of these is the better variable name to use?
A       a       Area      AREA        area      areaOfRectangle       AreaOfRectangle
The best variable name to use is “areaOfRectangle”

4.	Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one might be wrong.)
apple      APPLE     Apple2        1Apple   account number          account_number       account.number    accountNumber       fred  Fred   return   return_value   5Return
GreatBigVariable   greatBigVariable   great_big_variable   great.big.variable     2x 

Return is the only variable name not allowed in python from the above list

5.	Explain the mistake in the following code:
radius = input("Radius:")
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi * radius ** 2
The mistake in the above code is that exponentiation was used instead of multiplication “area = pi * radius ** 2"
The correct code is area = pi * radius * 2

6.	Explain the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3*(x + y)
The above code is missing the multiplication symbol between “3” and “(x+y)”
7.	Explain the mistake in the following code:
radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
The code is incorrect because float is being used when there are no decimal points.

8.	Why does this code not calculate the average?
print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
the layout of the code is incorrect because 
print(3 + 4 + 5) / 3

9.	Consider the following code:
x = 19.93
y = 20.00
z = y – x
print(z)
The output is 0.0700000000028    Why ?   
Improve the code so that the output is to two decimal places.

x = 19.93
y = 20.00
z = y – x
print(“%.2f”%z)

 

10.	Find at least three compile-time errors:
int x = 2
Print (x, squared is, x * x)
xcubed = x *** 3
error 1: int x is not a valid variable name
error 2: squared it must be in quote
error 3 : there is no operator *** in python

11.	Find two run-time errors:
from math import sqrt
X = 2
Y = 4
print(“The product of “, x, “and”, y, “is”, x + y)
print(“The root of their difference is “, sqrt(x – y))

Error due to negative value of x-y in sqrt function.

12.	Write statements to prompt user for their name and age
Write a print statement to output:
Hello ____, next year you will be ____ years old!

name=input("Enter your name ")
age=int(input("Enter your age "))
print("Hello",name," next year you will be",(age+1)," years old!")
 


13.	Given that radius is 2 and area is calculated as 12.5678, use string format operators to print the values of the variables radius and area so that the output looks like this:
Radius is: 	          2
Area is:	  12.57

 
14.	What are the values of the following expressions, assuming that p is 17 and q is 18?
i.	p // 10 + p % 10   :  1+8=9
ii.	p % 2  + q % 2  :  1+0=1
iii.	(p + q) // 2    : (17+18)//2 = 17
iv.	(p + q) / 2.0     : 17.5
